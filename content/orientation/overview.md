Welcome to the Webpacker Survival Guide.

This site is comprised of several sections.

## Orientation

You're currently at the start of [Orientation](/orientation/). If you're new to Webpacker, confused about what it is, what it does, and what you should know, this is where to start. The Orientation is intended to be a bare minimum overview especially for developers familiar with Sprockets and the classic Rails asset pipeline.

## Tour

Next is the guided [Tour](/tour/), an hands-on, in-depth tutorial to setting up and using Webpacker in a Rails application. Each section in the Tour is designed to build on the previous, taking you from zero to a deployed Rails + Webpacker application.

Highlights of the Tour include:

- installation
- directory structure
- configuration
- managing JavaScript and CSS
- using images
- local development concerns
- testing
- deployment
- optimization
