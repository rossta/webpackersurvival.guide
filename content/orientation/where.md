If you've used Rails for long enough, it would be reasonable to expect adopting Webpacker in your Rails app would be a seamless experience. Drop your assets in a folder, add a few dependencies, and everything "just works." This is what we've come to expect from the Rails asset pipeline on top of Sprockets for nearly ten years since it was [introduced in Rails 3.1 on August 31, 2011](https://weblog.rubyonrails.org/2011/8/31/rails-3-1-0-has-been-released/).

Since that time, the popularity of JavaScript exploded, arguably fueled by Node.js, which made it easier to run JavaScript on a server. Node.js introduced many JavaScript developers to the concept of "modules", namely [CommonJS](http://www.commonjs.org/).
