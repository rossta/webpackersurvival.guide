In this section, we'll compare how you get things done in Sprockets and Webpacker, side-by-side.

### Importing JavaScript

Different expressions are used in Webpacker and Sprockets to include another JavaScript file in the resulting asset bundle

<SprocketsVsWebpackerTabs>
<TabItem value="webpacker">

In Webpacker, files are included in a bundle with "imports". An import expression can produce local reference(s) to the file's exports.

```js title="app/packs/javascript/another-module.js"
export default class AnotherModule {}
```

```js title="app/packs/javascript/some-file.js"
import AnotherModule from './another-module'

const other = new AnotherModule()
```

An import is local to the file where it is used. To use it in different files, you'd need to repeat the import expression.

```js title="app/packs/javascript/a-second-file.js"
import AnotherModule from './another-module'

const other = new AnotherModule()
```

For more info, see [Importing and Exporting in Detail - Exploring ES6](https://exploringjs.com/es6/ch_modules.html#sec_importing-exporting-details)

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="sprockets">

Sprockets requires relies on special comment-based syntax which must rely solely on side-effects. Any references would need to be accessed through global scope.

```js title="app/assets/javascripts/some-file.js"
//= require ./another-file

var other = new window.AnotherFile()
```

This also means you'd only require the file once for use anywhere in a given bundle and require statements are order-dependent.

```js title="app/assets/javascripts/some-file-required-later.js"
var other = new window.AnotherFile()
```

</TabItem>
</SprocketsVsWebpackerTabs>

### Importing third-party JavaScript

Third-party JavaScript is packaged, distributed, and installed differently depending on which Rails asset bundler you're using.

<SprocketsVsWebpackerTabs>
<TabItem value="webpacker">

Third-party node packages for Webpacker are typically installed with `yarn`.

```bash
yarn add lodash
```

This programmatically adds the library to project's `package.json` file and adds it to the local `node_modules` directory on disk.

```json file="package.json"
"lodash-es": "^4.17.21",
```

Import the library in any file where its references are needed. The module will only be inclued once in a given bundle.

```js title="app/packs/src/widget1.js"
import { pick } from 'lodash-es'

const object = { a: 1, b: '2', c: 3 }

pick(object, ['a', 'c'])
// => { a: 1, c: 3 }
```

```js title="app/packs/src/widget2.js"
import { pick } from 'lodash-es'

const object = { d: 2, e: '3', f: 4 }

pick(object, ['d', 'f'])
// => { d: 2, f: 4 }
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="sprockets">

Sprockets relies on directory conventions for loading assets from third-party gems.

Install Ruby gem containing Sprockets-friendly assets with Bundler. This example uses the [lodash-rails](https://github.com/rh/lodash-rails) gem.

```ruby title="Gemfile"
gem "lodash-rails"
```

Require the library once in your asset bundle.

```js title="app/assets/application.js"
//= require lodash
```

Access global references from anywhere.

```js title="app/assets/widget.js"
const object = { a: 1, b: '2', c: 3 }

_.pick(object, ['a', 'c'])
// => { 'a': 1, 'c': 3 }
```

</TabItem>
</SprocketsVsWebpackerTabs>

### Rendering scripts

Rails provides view helpers to render script tags containing the path or URL to bundled assets using the assets' canonical names.

<SprocketsVsWebpackerTabs>

<TabItem value="webpacker">

In Webpacker, use `javascript_pack_tag`. Only the files located in the `app/packs/entrypoints` directory are available as bundled assets.

```bash
app
├── packs
│   ├── src
│   │   └── welcome.js
│   │   └── components
│   │       └── Button.js
│   └── entrypoints
│       └── application.js
```

In your layout:

```erb
<%= javascript_pack_tag 'application' %>
```

When Webpacker is configured to optimize the output into "split chunks" ( default in Webpacker 6), you'll likely see multiple files output as a result:

```html
<script src="/packs/js/runtime-abc...123.js">
<script src="/packs/js/application-abc...123.js">
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="sprockets">

In Sprockets, use `javascript_include_tag`.

```bash
app
├── assets
│   ├── config
│   │   └── manifest.js
│   ├── images
│   ├── javascripts
│   │   └── application.js
│   └── stylesheets
│       └── application.css
```

In your layout:

```erb
<%= javascript_include_tag 'application' %>
```

Depending on your Sprockets configuration, you'll either see each bundled file output separately or resulting combine bundle with a fingerprinted asset path:

```html
<script src="/packs/js/application-abc...123.js">
```

</TabItem>

</SprocketsVsWebpackerTabs>

### Importing multiple files at once

It's occasionally preferable to bundle many files using a single expression. In Webpacker, the strategy is more explicit and offers fine-grained control while the Sprockets approach is simpler and "just works."

<SprocketsVsWebpackerTabs>
<TabItem value="webpacker">

To import multiple files at once, webpack provides the `require.context` function. Think of "context" as a directory.

```js
/* require.context(
  directory,
  (useSubdirectories = true),
  (regExp = /^\.\/.*$/),
  (mode = 'sync')
); */
require.context('./components', true, /\.js$/)
```

Additional boilerplate is needed to access imports from `require.context`:

```js
const modules = {}

function importAll(r) {
  r.keys().forEach((key) => (modules[key] = r(key)))
}

importAll(require.context('../components/', true, /\.js$/))

// modules['post_component'], etc.
```

:::note
TODO - Link to future require.context recipes
:::

See the webpack docs for more about the [`require.context`](https://webpack.js.org/guides/dependency-management/#requirecontext) API.

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="sprockets">

The `require_tree` directive makes it easy to require all the files in the given directory.

```js
//= require_tree ./components
//= require_tree ./admin
```

</TabItem>
</SprocketsVsWebpackerTabs>

### Importing CSS

Both Webpacker and Sprockets can import and CSS into stylesheet bundles.

<SprocketsVsWebpackerTabs>
<TabItem value="webpacker">

When using SASS/SCSS, additional SASS/SCSS files can be included using `@import` expressions.

```css
@import './welcome.scss';
```

Since webpack treats everything as a module, you can (surprisingly) import CSS from JavaScript files. Webpacker is typically configured to "extract" this CSS into the resulting stylesheet bundle.

```js title="app/packs/javascript/anyfile.js"
import './stylesheets/welcome.scss'
```

:::note
As of Webpacker 6, CSS is not processed by default, but Webpacker will be configured for CSS processing automatically once you have [additional prerequisites](/). TODO: Link
:::

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="sprockets">

```css
//= require ./welcome.scss
```

```css
@import '../welcome.scss';
```

</TabItem>
</SprocketsVsWebpackerTabs>

### Rendering stylesheets

<SprocketsVsWebpackerTabs>
<TabItem value="webpacker">

Given an entrypoint `application.scss` and `welcome.scss`.

```bash
app
├── packs
│   ├── stylesheets
│   │   └── button.scss
│   └── entrypoints
│       ├── application.js
│       └── application.scss
│       └── welcome.scss
```

Render the stylesheet tags in the view as follows.

```erb file="app/views/layouts/application"
<%= stylesheet_pack_tag 'application' %>
<%= stylesheet_pack_tag 'welcome' %>
```

Non-entrypoint files like 'button.scss' should be [imported](#importing-css) from somewhere in the dependency graph.

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="sprockets">

Given a Sprockets asset designated for precompilation such as `application.scss`

```bash
app
├── assets
│   └── stylesheets
│       └── application.scss
│       └── welcome.scss
```

#### Sprockets 3

```rb file="config/initializers/assets.rb"
Rails.assets.precompile += ['welcome.scss']
```

#### Sprockets 4

```js file="config/assets/manifest.js"
// JS and CSS bundles
//
//= link_directory ../javascripts .js
//= link_directory ../stylesheets .css

// Images and fonts so that views can link to them
//
//= link_tree ../fonts
//= link_tree ../images
```

Render the stylesheet tag in the view as follows

```erb file="app/views/layouts/application"
<%= stylesheet_link_tag 'application' %>
```

</TabItem>
</SprocketsVsWebpackerTabs>

### Rendering images

Images need to be processed to be referenced in Rails view templates (ERB, HAML,etc.)

<SprocketsVsWebpackerTabs>

<TabItem value="webpacker">

1.  Place images in a directory of your choice. Webpacker does not automatically process images unless you manually import them.

```sh
app/packs
└── images
    ├── backpack.jpg
    ├── travel
        └── fannypack.jpg
```

2. Import image from a Webpacker JavaScript file

```js
import '../images/backpack.jpg'
```

See [requiring multiple files](/) to import many images

3.  Use `image_pack_tag` helper in view

```erb
<%= image_pack_tag 'backpack.jpg' %>
```

```erb
<%= image_pack_tag 'travel/backpack.jpg' %>
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="sprockets">

1.  Place images in `app/assets/images` directory

```sh
app/assets
└── images
    ├── backpack.jpg
    ├── travel
        └── fannypack.jpg
```

2.  Use `image_tag` helper in view

```erb
<%= image_tag 'backpack.jpg' %>
```

```erb
<%= image_tag 'travel/backpack.jpg' %>
```

</TabItem>
</SprocketsVsWebpackerTabs>

### Adding bundles

<SprocketsVsWebpackerTabs>

Both Webpacker and Sprockets use the top-level file, or entrypoint, to a bundle as the canonical identifier.

<TabItem value="webpacker">

Webpacker automatically determines what files are entrypoints from directory structure.

Any file in the `app/packs/entrypoints` directory in Webpacker 6 (or in `app/javascript/packs` for Webpacker 5 and below) is treated as a separate entrypoint. Webpacker will recognize a JavaScript and CSS file of the same canonical name as part of the same bundle. So in the example directory structure below, Webpacker will find two entrypoints, `application` and `welcome`.

```bash
app
├── packs
│   ├── stylesheets
│   │   └── button.scss
│   └── entrypoints
│       ├── application.js
│       └── application.scss
│       └── welcome.scss
```

:::caution

It is very important that only entrypoint files are placed in this directory. [A common Webpacker mistake is to place too many (or even all) JavaScript source files](https://rossta.net/blog/overpacking-a-common-webpacker-mistake.html).

:::

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="sprockets">

#### Sprockets 3

Prior to Sprockets 4, specifying bundle entrypoints other than `application.js` and `application.css` involves setting the `assets.precompile` array in the Rails configuration

```rb file="config/initializers/assets.rb"
Rails.application.assets.precompile += ['welcome.js']
```

#### Sprockets 4

Sprockets 4 changed to the JavaScript manifest file. The following configuration would mean any file in the top-level `app/assets/javascripts` and `app/assets/stylesheets` directories would be precompiled as bundle entrypoints.

```js file="config/assets/manifest.js"
// JS and CSS bundles
//
//= link_directory ../javascripts .js
//= link_directory ../stylesheets .css
```

</TabItem>
</SprocketsVsWebpackerTabs>

## Rendering asset path or URL

In some cases, you want to access just the path to an asset.

<SprocketsVsWebpackerTabs>
  <TabItem value="webpacker">

```erb
<%= asset_pack_path 'application.js' %>
<%= asset_pack_url 'application.js' %>
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="sprockets">

```erb
<%= asset_path 'application.js' %>
<%= asset_url 'application.js' %>
```

  </TabItem>
</SprocketsVsWebpackerTabs>

## Rendering favicon

<SprocketsVsWebpackerTabs>
  <TabItem value="webpacker">
```bash
app
├── packs
│   ├── images
│   │   └── favicon.png
│   └── entrypoints
│       └── application.js
```

```js file="app/packs/entrypoints/application.js"
// import the favicon png explicitly
import '../images/favicon.png'
// OR
// require all files in the images directory
require.context('../images', true)
```

```erb
<%= favicon_pack_tag 'favicon.png' %>
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="sprockets">

```bash
app
├── assets
│   ├── images
│   │   └── favicon.png
```

```erb
<%= favicon_link_tag 'favicon.png' %>
```

  </TabItem>
</SprocketsVsWebpackerTabs>

## Running precompilation

Assets can be compiled for production with tasks shown below.

<SprocketsVsWebpackerTabs>
  <TabItem value="webpacker">

The following commands will run both Sprockets and Webpacker compilation if both are installed.

```
rails assets:precompile
```

The following command will run just Webpacker compilation.

```
rails webpacker:precompile
```

Webpacker will also compile with the Webpacker binstub.

```
bin/webpack
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="sprockets">

The following command will run asset pipeline compilation.

```
rails assets:precompile
```

  </TabItem>
</SprocketsVsWebpackerTabs>
