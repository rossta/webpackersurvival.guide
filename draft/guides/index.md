# Welcome to Webpacker on Rails

Like it or not, you've reached a point where you have to learn how to use with Webpacker to bundle JavaScript and possibly CSS, and/or images.

That's why you're here.

Whether you're in th midst of migrating from the Rails asset pipeline in a large legacy application or you're starting a new app and just need to know how in the world to get your JavaScript and CSS to work properly... you're in the right place.

Maybe you've been building Rails apps on the Rails asset pipeline comfortably for severals years and you're trying to make sense of this new compilation tool. Perhaps you're new to Rails development in general.

## Pain points

There's been a ton of innovation in frontend development over the past decade and with that, things have also gotten really complex; webpack is no exception. It can be really hard to understand. To top it off, there's no official Rails guide (yet, though there's an [open PR to add one](https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/40817)). It's a big confusing mess.

## What you'll get out of this resource

This guide will provide a step-by-step overview of getting a Rails application working with Webpacker.
